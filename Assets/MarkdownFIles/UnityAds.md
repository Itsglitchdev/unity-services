  Assets > External Dependency Manager > Android Resolver > Resolve
  ```
- Run **Resolve** once to fetch necessary dependencies

### 7. Android Resolver Settings
- Use the **default settings** in Android Resolver
- No need to change anything unless required by another SDK
- These defaults are safe and stable for building
